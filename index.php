<!-- MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR (3) IMAGES SAVED INTO YOUR IMAGES FOLDER -->

 <p>I'm Dana, a Web Development student at Seattle Central who hopes to work as a front end developer. I'm sort of a weird futurist who loves sushi, cats, cool cartoons and comics, and spending time with my girlfriends. My platform of choice is Linux, currently running Mint 20.1.  I love being able to get right at things through the shell. Typing "mkdir foldername" is so much easier than wading through a bunch of dropdown menus. I have a background in both art and science. I've always loved to draw, and I've always liked science and technology as well, so it makes sense that I eventually gravitated toward web development.</p>
